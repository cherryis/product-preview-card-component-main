## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox, @media for responsive design
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS) 


### What I learned

It was hard to learn @media query and flexbox. This 1st project of responsive design took over a week to play. 



If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)  - This helped me for writing README.md. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS Flexbox 완전 정리](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neASrWEFEM) - This is an amazing tutorial which helped me understand CSS Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
