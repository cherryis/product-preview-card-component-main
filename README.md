### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)  - This helped me for writing README.md. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS Flexbox 완전 정리](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neASrWEFEM) - This is an amazing tutorial which helped me understand CSS Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
